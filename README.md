# Platform Library Workflows

This repository contains centrally managed [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows). Rather than copying and pasting deployment jobs from one workflow to another, you can create a reusable workflow that performs the deployment steps. A reusable workflow can be used by another workflow if it meets one of the access requirements described in "[Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)."

[Using OpenID Connect with reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/using-openid-connect-with-reusable-workflows), reusable workflows can be used to facilitate standardization and security-hardening of deployment steps.
